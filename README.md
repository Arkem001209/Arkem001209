- Hi im Max. I am learning how to code whilst looking for data and software development roles.
- I have recently moved to Australia where ill be living for at least the next year.
- I primarily work in SQL, Python and C# using my coding knowledge and my experience covers automation, data management, data visualisation and bespoke software solutions for financial services.
- I am also working on my own personal software and data projects to sharpen my programming skills.
- Iâ€™m currently using SQL, Python, Java and c# in my work and personal projects.
- My current project is a Java fitness application called "Do Your Zone 2" which tracks dedication to sticking to zone 2 heart rate zones during aerobic exercise. Im using this project to learn Java.
